00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,140
what's up everyone welcome back to the

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:06,150
second channel so as you guys know these

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,309
Samsung Galaxy S 10 light just got

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,769
announced yesterday and I didn't get a

5
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,480
chance to do the Galaxy S and E versus

6
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,280
the s10 light quick comparison that I

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,929
wanted to do but I figured I would drop

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,820
it on the second channel a quick

9
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,100
disclaimer the galaxy has time the light

10
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,990
is not available for everyone to own yet

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,369
it was just strictly announced I've seen

12
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,350
a couple of videos here and there people

13
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,970
owning one but or really Samsung giving

14
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,500
them the right to use some footage or

15
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,240
some like that but I wanted to do a

16
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,740
quick comparison to see what the main

17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,540
differences are between both of these

18
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,430
phones now technically speaking these

19
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,530
will be some of the cheapest Samsung

20
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,690
Galaxy flagship II type of phones that

21
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,520
Samsung will put out now I was kind of

22
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,649
confused why Samsung would push the

23
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,140
galaxy s 10 light so far into the life

24
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,120
cycle of this 10 series when the S 20 or

25
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,530
s11 is about to come out but we kind of

26
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,600
saw Google do the same thing with the

27
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,890
pixel 3 a so it's really not that big of

28
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,210
a deal anymore I don't think after I put

29
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,620
a little bit of thought into it now

30
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,050
looking at the front of both these

31
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,059
phones the Samsung Galaxy S 10 has a

32
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,760
five point eight inch dynamic AMOLED

33
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,409
display that one is a 1080p display and

34
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,000
that one was a really good panel I'm not

35
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,770
gonna lie it was very good every which

36
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,689
way I looked at it I mean yeah it wasn't

37
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,210
a quad HD or anything it wasn't like a

38
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,770
crazy cool looking panel but because it

39
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,990
was smaller it didn't really look too

40
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,130
pixelated the PPI did the pixels per

41
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,409
inch density was actually pretty high

42
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,470
but the galaxy s 10 light has a six

43
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,119
point seven inch full HD Super AMOLED

44
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,009
display they both have infinity o

45
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,659
displays but the Samsung Galaxy S 10

46
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,220
lights is in the center but that's 10

47
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,530
light will be not only a bigger phone

48
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,780
than the galaxy s 10 II but also the

49
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,909
galaxy s 10 I mean that's pretty crazy

50
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,619
we don't really see light or budget

51
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,079
phones being bigger than the actual

52
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,670
phone itself then the flagship phone so

53
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,399
it's really weird that resolution on

54
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,259
that panel is 1080p by 2400 a little bit

55
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,060
higher resolution panel but it's because

56
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,369
it was just a bigger panel but the PPI

57
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,750
is smaller on the galaxy s 10 light so

58
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:53,729
there's technically less pixels on that

59
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,590
display then on the galaxy s 10 deeper

60
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,479
inch so in terms of the panel's they'll

61
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,860
both look almost the same in my opinion

62
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,630
but I like how that stand lights

63
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,890
hole-punch displays in the center or

64
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,570
either destiny's which is in the top

65
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,579
right corner now turning both phones

66
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,710
around what's interesting is the galaxy

67
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:09,390
s 10 e actually has one less camera

68
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,129
sensor than that has tena light so we

69
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,349
have a dual camera setup on the galaxy s

70
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:13,890
10 e we have a 12 megapixel wide-angle

71
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:16,170
lens and then

72
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,940
16-megapixel ultralight sensor you're

73
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,590
able to do for Kade up to 60 frames per

74
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,190
second and that camera is actually

75
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,170
pretty good

76
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,370
I like that camera whenever I would use

77
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,050
it whenever I would do anything with it

78
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,580
I liked it a lot it was a very good

79
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,980
camera the gallic says 10 light however

80
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,440
has a triple camera setup it has a 5

81
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,120
megapixel macro lens a 48 megapixel

82
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,640
wide-angle lens and then a 12 megapixel

83
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,410
ultra-wide sensors so so that's really

84
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,330
cool we do have an extra sensor on the

85
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,250
galaxy s 10 light but I still have a

86
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,960
feeling that the galaxy s 10 e might

87
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,820
have the better camera sensor overall

88
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,320
but once I actually go ahead and get the

89
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,850
s 10 light I'll go ahead do a full on

90
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,320
comparison between them but in terms of

91
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,760
the cameras and everything I'm sure

92
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,800
they'll be around the same type of

93
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,240
quality and features and all that but I

94
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,160
sell with feeling the S 10 D might be

95
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,020
the better camera sensor overall now

96
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,370
getting into the performance side of

97
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,860
things this is where things might get a

98
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,350
little interesting so the galaxy s 10 D

99
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,080
has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset an

100
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,790
octa-core CPU with 6 gigabytes of RAM on

101
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,560
the base model and then eight gigabytes

102
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,870
of RAM on the top tier model and the

103
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,190
Galaxy S 10 light follows the same exact

104
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,470
thing you know it has the octa-core

105
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,540
processor we don't know yet whether it

106
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,650
has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 or in

107
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,660
other chips that we really don't know

108
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,000
yet but people are suggesting that it is

109
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,800
getting the 855 and the RAM is the same

110
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,209
exact way we either get six or eight

111
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,130
gigabytes of RAM whether you want the

112
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:30,810
base model or the top tier model however

113
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,940
one thing that we are noting is that

114
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,280
there's only a 128 gigabyte storage

115
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,080
model but there is probably a microSD

116
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,700
card slot on it so it shouldn't be that

117
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,350
crazy of a deal with solis that's a good

118
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,450
thing now ending it off with the battery

119
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,910
life in the battery size mostly so the

120
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,860
galaxy s 10 D had a 30 100 million power

121
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,390
battery and that battery life was kind

122
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,160
of it was pretty average I think it was

123
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,019
a little bit above average but it wasn't

124
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,550
anything crazy the s10 plus had a pretty

125
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,950
good battery life the s10 had pretty

126
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:58,920
decent battery life destiny was ok the

127
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,840
galaxy s 10 light however has a 4,500

128
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,030
million for her battery which is insane

129
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,280
at a phone of this caliber the cheaper

130
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,110
phone of the regular s10 has a bigger

131
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,670
sized battery than the standard models

132
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,110
which doesn't make much sense to me but

133
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,269
it does have a way bigger battery size

134
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,890
than the galaxy s 10 II so between

135
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:15,450
battery life the galaxy s tonight will

136
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,459
have the bigger advantage so to kind of

137
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,930
sum up this quick comparison should you

138
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,609
wait for the s10 life to be fully

139
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,229
announced or should you pick up a Galaxy

140
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:24,120
S 10 II well we don't know what the

141
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,289
price set is of the S 10 light people

142
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,270
are estimating that is going to cost

143
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:28,860
$4.99 or something like that

144
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,300
five ninety-nine even which will still

145
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,160
technically be cheaper than a brand new

146
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,259
Galaxy S ten II but you can pick up a

147
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,370
used as tiny for like four hundred even

148
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,289
less than four hundred in the used

149
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,729
market you can pick up a standard as ten

150
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:40,199
for less than four hundred so I'll

151
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:42,180
probably recommend you if you need it

152
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,710
right now you can pick up a Galaxy S 10

153
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,150
II in the use market for like four

154
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,500
hundred less than four hundred or you

155
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,240
can always wait for that student like to

156
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,009
come out or wait for more details to

157
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,330
come out for it it never hurts to wait

158
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:53,159
for a phone especially when you know

159
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,659
what's about to come out so that's kind

160
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:56,370
of what I would suggest at this time but

161
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:58,169
that is pretty much it guys if you have

162
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,699
