these</text><text start="4.14" dur="4.169">Samsung Galaxy S 10 light just got</text><text start="6.15" dur="4.619">announced yesterday and I didn&amp;#39;t get a</text><text start="8.309" dur="4.171">chance to do the Galaxy S and E versus</text><text start="10.769" dur="3.511">the s10 light quick comparison that I</text><text start="12.48" dur="3.449">wanted to do but I figured I would drop</text><text start="14.28" dur="3.54">it on the second channel a quick</text><text start="15.929" dur="4.171">disclaimer the galaxy has time the light</text><text start="17.82" dur="4.17">is not available for everyone to own yet</text><text start="20.1" dur="3.269">it was just strictly announced I&amp;#39;ve seen</text><text start="21.99" dur="3.36">a couple of videos here and there people</text><text start="23.369" dur="3.601">owning one but or really Samsung giving</text><text start="25.35" dur="3.15">them the right to use some footage or</text><text start="26.97" dur="3.27">some like that but I wanted to do a</text><text start="28.5" dur="3.24">quick comparison to see what the main</text><text start="30.24" dur="3.3">differences are between both of these</text><text start="31.74" dur="3.69">phones now technically speaking these</text><text start="33.54" dur="3.99">will be some of the cheapest Samsung</text><text start="35.43" dur="4.26">Galaxy flagship II type of phones that</text><text start="37.53" dur="3.99">Samsung will put out now I was kind of</text><text start="39.69" dur="3.959">confused why Samsung would push the</text><text start="41.52" dur="4.62">galaxy s 10 light so far into the life</text><text start="43.649" dur="4.471">cycle of this 10 series when the S 20 or</text><text start="46.14" dur="3.39">s11 is about to come out but we kind of</text><text start="48.12" dur="3.48">saw Google do the same thing with the</text><text start="49.53" dur="3.36">pixel 3 a so it&amp;#39;s really not that big of</text><text start="51.6" dur="2.61">a deal anymore I don&amp;#39;t think after I put</text><text start="52.89" dur="2.73">a little bit of thought into it now</text><text start="54.21" dur="3.84">looking at the front of both these</text><text start="55.62" dur="4.439">phones the Samsung Galaxy S 10 has a</text><text start="58.05" dur="4.71">five point eight inch dynamic AMOLED</text><text start="60.059" dur="4.35">display that one is a 1080p display and</text><text start="62.76" dur="3.24">that one was a really good panel I&amp;#39;m not</text><text start="64.409" dur="3.361">gonna lie it was very good every which</text><text start="66" dur="3.689">way I looked at it I mean yeah it wasn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="67.77" dur="4.44">a quad HD or anything it wasn&amp;#39;t like a</text><text start="69.689" dur="4.081">crazy cool looking panel but because it</text><text start="72.21" dur="3.78">was smaller it didn&amp;#39;t really look too</text><text start="73.77" dur="3.36">pixelated the PPI did the pixels per</text><text start="75.99" dur="3.419">inch density was actually pretty high</text><text start="77.13" dur="5.34">but the galaxy s 10 light has a six</text><text start="79.409" dur="4.71">point seven inch full HD Super AMOLED</text><text start="82.47" dur="3.539">display they both have infinity o</text><text start="84.119" dur="3.54">displays but the Samsung Galaxy S 10</text><text start="86.009" dur="3.211">lights is in the center but that&amp;#39;s 10</text><text start="87.659" dur="3.871">light will be not only a bigger phone</text><text start="89.22" dur="4.56">than the galaxy s 10 II but also the</text><text start="91.53" dur="4.379">galaxy s 10 I mean that&amp;#39;s pretty crazy</text><text start="93.78" dur="3.839">we don&amp;#39;t really see light or budget</text><text start="95.909" dur="4.17">phones being bigger than the actual</text><text start="97.619" dur="4.051">phone itself then the flagship phone so</text><text start="100.079" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s really weird that resolution on</text><text start="101.67" dur="4.589">that panel is 1080p by 2400 a little bit</text><text start="104.399" dur="3.661">higher resolution panel but it&amp;#39;s because</text><text start="106.259" dur="4.11">it was just a bigger panel but the PPI</text><text start="108.06" dur="3.69">is smaller on the galaxy s 10 light so</text><text start="110.369" dur="3.36">there&amp;#39;s technically less pixels on that</text><text start="111.75" dur="3.84">display then on the galaxy s 10 deeper</text><text start="113.729" dur="3.75">inch so in terms of the panel&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="115.59" dur="3.27">both look almost the same in my opinion</text><text start="117.479" dur="3.151">but I like how that stand lights</text><text start="118.86" dur="3.03">hole-punch displays in the center or</text><text start="120.63" dur="2.94">either destiny&amp;#39;s which is in the top</text><text start="121.89" dur="3.689">right corner now turning both phones</text><text start="123.57" dur="4.14">around what&amp;#39;s interesting is the galaxy</text><text start="125.579" dur="3.811">s 10 e actually has one less camera</text><text start="127.71" dur="3.419">sensor than that has tena light so we</text><text start="129.39" dur="3.959">have a dual camera setup on the galaxy s</text><text start="131.129" dur="2.761">10 e we have a 12 megapixel wide-angle</text><text start="133.349" dur="2.821">lens and then</text><text start="133.89" dur="4.05">16-megapixel ultralight sensor you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="136.17" dur="3.42">able to do for Kade up to 60 frames per</text><text start="137.94" dur="2.25">second and that camera is actually</text><text start="139.59" dur="2.58">pretty good</text><text start="140.19" dur="3.18">I like that camera whenever I would use</text><text start="142.17" dur="2.88">it whenever I would do anything with it</text><text start="143.37" dur="3.21">I liked it a lot it was a very good</text><text start="145.05" dur="3.93">camera the gallic says 10 light however</text><text start="146.58" dur="4.86">has a triple camera setup it has a 5</text><text start="148.98" dur="4.14">megapixel macro lens a 48 megapixel</text><text start="151.44" dur="4.2">wide-angle lens and then a 12 megapixel</text><text start="153.12" dur="4.29">ultra-wide sensors so so that&amp;#39;s really</text><text start="155.64" dur="3.69">cool we do have an extra sensor on the</text><text start="157.41" dur="3.84">galaxy s 10 light but I still have a</text><text start="159.33" dur="3.63">feeling that the galaxy s 10 e might</text><text start="161.25" dur="3.57">have the better camera sensor overall</text><text start="162.96" dur="3.36">but once I actually go ahead and get the</text><text start="164.82" dur="3.03">s 10 light I&amp;#39;ll go ahead do a full on</text><text start="166.32" dur="3">comparison between them but in terms of</text><text start="167.85" dur="2.91">the cameras and everything I&amp;#39;m sure</text><text start="169.32" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;ll be around the same type of</text><text start="170.76" dur="3.48">quality and features and all that but I</text><text start="172.8" dur="3.36">sell with feeling the S 10 D might be</text><text start="174.24" dur="3.78">the better camera sensor overall now</text><text start="176.16" dur="3.21">getting into the performance side of</text><text start="178.02" dur="3.84">things this is where things might get a</text><text start="179.37" dur="4.98">little interesting so the galaxy s 10 D</text><text start="181.86" dur="5.22">has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset an</text><text start="184.35" dur="4.44">octa-core CPU with 6 gigabytes of RAM on</text><text start="187.08" dur="3.48">the base model and then eight gigabytes</text><text start="188.79" dur="4.08">of RAM on the top tier model and the</text><text start="190.56" dur="3.63">Galaxy S 10 light follows the same exact</text><text start="192.87" dur="3.6">thing you know it has the octa-core</text><text start="194.19" dur="4.35">processor we don&amp;#39;t know yet whether it</text><text start="196.47" dur="3.18">has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 or in</text><text start="198.54" dur="3.12">other chips that we really don&amp;#39;t know</text><text start="199.65" dur="4.35">yet but people are suggesting that it is</text><text start="201.66" dur="4.14">getting the 855 and the RAM is the same</text><text start="204" dur="3.209">exact way we either get six or eight</text><text start="205.8" dur="3.33">gigabytes of RAM whether you want the</text><text start="207.209" dur="3.601">base model or the top tier model however</text><text start="209.13" dur="3.81">one thing that we are noting is that</text><text start="210.81" dur="4.47">there&amp;#39;s only a 128 gigabyte storage</text><text start="212.94" dur="4.14">model but there is probably a microSD</text><text start="215.28" dur="3.42">card slot on it so it shouldn&amp;#39;t be that</text><text start="217.08" dur="3.27">crazy of a deal with solis that&amp;#39;s a good</text><text start="218.7" dur="3.75">thing now ending it off with the battery</text><text start="220.35" dur="4.56">life in the battery size mostly so the</text><text start="222.45" dur="4.41">galaxy s 10 D had a 30 100 million power</text><text start="224.91" dur="3.48">battery and that battery life was kind</text><text start="226.86" dur="3.3">of it was pretty average I think it was</text><text start="228.39" dur="3.629">a little bit above average but it wasn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="230.16" dur="3.39">anything crazy the s10 plus had a pretty</text><text start="232.019" dur="3.931">good battery life the s10 had pretty</text><text start="233.55" dur="5.37">decent battery life destiny was ok the</text><text start="235.95" dur="4.89">galaxy s 10 light however has a 4,500</text><text start="238.92" dur="4.11">million for her battery which is insane</text><text start="240.84" dur="4.44">at a phone of this caliber the cheaper</text><text start="243.03" dur="4.08">phone of the regular s10 has a bigger</text><text start="245.28" dur="3.39">sized battery than the standard models</text><text start="247.11" dur="3">which doesn&amp;#39;t make much sense to me but</text><text start="248.67" dur="3.599">it does have a way bigger battery size</text><text start="250.11" dur="3.78">than the galaxy s 10 II so between</text><text start="252.269" dur="3.181">battery life the galaxy s tonight will</text><text start="253.89" dur="3.569">have the bigger advantage so to kind of</text><text start="255.45" dur="3.48">sum up this quick comparison should you</text><text start="257.459" dur="3.15">wait for the s10 life to be fully</text><text start="258.93" dur="3.299">announced or should you pick up a Galaxy</text><text start="260.609" dur="3.511">S 10 II well we don&amp;#39;t know what the</text><text start="262.229" dur="3.06">price set is of the S 10 light people</text><text start="264.12" dur="3.15">are estimating that is going to cost</text><text start="265.289" dur="3.571">$4.99 or something like that</text><text start="267.27" dur="3.03">five ninety-nine even which will still</text><text start="268.86" dur="3.3">technically be cheaper than a brand new</text><text start="270.3" dur="3.959">Galaxy S ten II but you can pick up a</text><text start="272.16" dur="3.21">used as tiny for like four hundred even</text><text start="274.259" dur="3.03">less than four hundred in the used</text><text start="275.37" dur="3.359">market you can pick up a standard as ten</text><text start="277.289" dur="2.91">for less than four hundred so I&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="278.729" dur="3.451">probably recommend you if you need it</text><text start="280.199" dur="3.511">right now you can pick up a Galaxy S 10</text><text start="282.18" dur="2.97">II in the use market for like four</text><text start="283.71" dur="2.79">hundred less than four hundred or you</text><text start="285.15" dur="3.09">can always wait for that student like to</text><text start="286.5" dur="3.509">come out or wait for more details to</text><text start="288.24" dur="3.09">come out for it it never hurts to wait</text><text start="290.009" dur="3.15">for a phone especially when you know</text><text start="291.33" dur="3.329">what&amp;#39;s about to come out so that&amp;#39;s kind</text><text start="293.159" dur="3.211">of what I would suggest at this time but</text><text
